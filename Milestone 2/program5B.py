"""
Algorithm5B uses dynamic programming to find the minimum total height for arranging
paintings on platforms with a fixed width constraint. By calculating the minimum
height for each subarray of paintings from 0 to i, it tracks the optimal splits 
for each platform configuration. This process ensures minimal height while respecting 
width constraints. The complexity is Î˜(n^2) due to evaluating each subarray.
